I am a PhD student working in arithmetic geometry working under the supervision of [Marta Pieropan](https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~piero001/).

<h2 class="archive__item-title" itemprop="headline">Research interests
</h2>
My research is about the study of special subsets of the rational points on an algebraic variety, both over number fields as well as over function fields. Examples of such special subsets include integral points, Campana points and Darmon points. I have devoped a common generalisation of these notions, called $\mathcal{M}$-points. For such points I am studying analogues of classical problems for rational points and integral points, such as weak/strong approximation, the Hilbert property and Manin's conjecture. My focus here lies on toric varieties, on which $\mathcal{M}$-points have a particularly nice arithmetic and geometric interpretation.
Alongside this, I am working on the connections between stacks and $\mathcal{M}$-points.
